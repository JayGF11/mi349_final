                        I attended Michigan State University to study Media and Information.
                        During my four years at this institution, my learning experience 
                        was consistently positive and I was able to learn the course contents
                        all while enjoying the time spent in the environment and with the people.

                        While studying for my bachelor's degree at MSU, I took courses that 
                        taught computer languages such as Python and C++. Then, I learned 
                        filming and video editing techniques to produce a complete product.
                        I also gained knowledge in creating video games through Unity which 
                        was a difficult but rewarding process to learn. Finally, I became 
                        familiar with HTML due to the course, MI 349, and was able to 
                        learn a bunch of information while enjoying the entire process.

                        Balancing class work and a job required good time management skills.
                        After four years of honing my skill of organization, I gained a habit
                        of needing to occupy myself at all times. My daily activities must 
                        include eating self-made healthy foods, exploring the internet, 
                        working out, and getting a full night of sleep.

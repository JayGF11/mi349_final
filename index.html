                        I attended Michigan State University to study Media and Information.
                        During my four years at this institution, my learning experience 
                        was consistently positive and I was able to learn the course contents
                        all while enjoying the time spent in the environment and with the people.

            <p>
                While studying for my bachelor's degree at MSU, I took courses that 
                taught computer languages such as Python and C++. Then, I learned 
                filming and video editing techniques to produce a complete product.
                I also gained knowledge in creating video games through Unity which 
                was a difficult but rewarding process to learn. Finally, I became 
                familiar with HTML due to the course, MI 349, and was able to 
                learn a bunch of information while enjoying the entire process.

            <p>
                Balancing class work and a job required good time management skills.
                After four years of honing my skill of organization, I gained a habit
                of needing to occupy myself at all times. My daily activities must 
                include eating self-made healthy foods, exploring the internet, 
                working out, and getting a full night of sleep.
